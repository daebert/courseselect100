# Course Selector

The app offers a selection of educational projects. Students select 3 projects from this list and assign a personal priority to each course. After the selection process, the app will automatically compare the selection and priorities with the course offering and make an allocation of the courses.

## Installing / Getting started

In the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```

Runs the server in production mode and serve production bundle from npm run build

```npm run dev:client```

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 (default PORT) to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

```
npm run dev:server
````

Runs the server in development mode.

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.
